This repository documents an **original theoretical model of Digital Government**, designed by the author before the adoption and dissemination of similar structures in national and international public policies.

The model proposes an integrated approach that involves:

- Strategic use of digital technologies as an institutional instrument

- Integration between administrative processes, data and public policies

- Reorganisation of the State from digital structures

It is a **theoretical formulation**, not restricted to technical implementation or system programming.
